<h1 align="center">CO2 emission prediction challenge üå®Ô∏è </h1>

The model was run as a Kaggle notebook in which datasets were saved

Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikeasamoahansah/co2-prediction-dataset/data

# 1. Setup

Test and Train files could not be uploaded to GitHub due to their sizes
Files can be found in the dataset link above

# 2. Order

The code should be run in the normal order (from top to bottom)
The file to be used is the [final_submission.ipynb](final_submission.ipynb) file

# 3. Explanations of Features Used


# 4. Environment

The model was trained on kaggle with a GPU P100 by Nvidia (all free to use) can also be run on a CPU

# 5. Hardware

A CPU or GPU is fine. GPU required for faster training time

# 6. Expected run time

with a GPU - 2 hrs 45 mins
only CPU - 7 hrs 30 mins
